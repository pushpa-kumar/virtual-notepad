# Virtual Notepad


This projectâ€™s main goal is to develop a virtual notepad that uses hand gestures captured by a webcam to enable users to write, erase, and predict handwritten characters. In order to provide a seamless drawing and writing experience, this project makes use of computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and respond to hand gestures.
